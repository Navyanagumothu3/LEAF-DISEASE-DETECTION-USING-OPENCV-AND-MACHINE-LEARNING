🌿 LEAF-DISEASE-DETECTION-USING-OPENCV-AND-MACHINE-LEARNING

This project uses **OpenCV** and **Machine Learning (CNN with TensorFlow/Keras)** to detect common leaf diseases from images and suggest basic treatments.  
It provides an easy-to-use interface with **Gradio** for uploading leaf images and getting predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects 4 classes:
  - Healthy
  - Bacterial Spot
  - Early Blight
  - Late Blight
- Confidence score for predictions
- Suggested treatment for each disease
- Interactive Gradio app for real-time detection

## 📂 Dataset
Organized into folders by class and split into train/validation


## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.12  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- Scikit-learn  
- Gradio  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  


## 📈 Results
Works on small datasets 
Accuracy improves with more images or transfer learning.
Includes confusion matrix and classification report for evaluation.

## 💡 Future Work
Add more images per class
Use transfer learning (MobileNet, ResNet)
Deploy as a cloud web app
